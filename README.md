# Bank-Loan-Case-Study
The main aim of this project is to identify patterns that indicate if a customer will have difficulty paying their installments. 
This information can be used to make decisions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, or lending at a higher interest rate to risky applicants. 
The company wants to understand the key factors behind loan default so it can make better decisions about loan approval.

My task is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze patterns in the data and ensure that capable applicants are not rejected and to understand how customer attributes and loan attributes influence the likelihood of default.
